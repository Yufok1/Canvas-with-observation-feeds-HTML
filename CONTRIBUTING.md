## Development Guidelines

### Project Structure
- Maintain dual HTML file architecture for separation of concerns
  - `canvas-with-observation-feeds.html`: Main canvas workspace and AI orchestration
  - `djinn-council-shadow-governance.html`: Governance surveillance and intelligence analysis
- Embed CSS and JavaScript within HTML files for simplicity
- Use semantic HTML5 elements
- Follow progressive enhancement principles
- Ensure consistent tooltip implementation across interfaces
