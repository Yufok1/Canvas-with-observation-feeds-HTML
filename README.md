- **Local Server**: Required for proper operation and local-only traffic (see below)

### AI Models
The application requires the following Ollama models:
- `gemma3:1b` (used for all AI systems)

### System Requirements
- **RAM**: 4GB minimum, 8GB recommended
- **Storage**: 2GB free space for models
- **Network**: Local Ollama connection (localhost:11434)

## Quick Start Guide

### Option 1: Professional Launch (Recommended)
Use the provided batch files for the ultimate launch experience:

1. **Double-click `launch-canvas.bat`**
2. Watch the ASCII art startup sequence
3. The script will automatically:
   - Start Ollama server (if not already running)
   - Launch Python web server
   - Open your browser to the application
   - Display real-time status updates

**That's it!** Enjoy the launch experience with full automation.

### Option 2: Manual Setup
If you prefer manual control:

#### Step 1: Download the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Yufok1/Canvas-with-observation-feeds-HTML.git
cd Canvas-with-observation-feeds-HTML
```

#### Step 2: Install Ollama
- Download from: https://ollama.ai/
- Install and run Ollama
- Pull the required model:
```bash
ollama pull gemma3:1b
```

#### Step 3: Start Ollama Server
```bash
ollama serve
```

#### Step 4: Start Local Web Server
**Important**: You must start the server from the project directory that contains the HTML file.

```bash
python -m http.server 8000
```

**Why this matters**: The web server serves files from the directory where it's started. If you start the server from a different directory, you'll get 404 errors when trying to access the HTML file.

#### Step 5: Access the Application
Open your browser and go to: `http://localhost:8000/canvas-with-observation-feeds.html`

**For DJINN Council Surveillance**: Access the governance interface at: `http://localhost:8000/djinn-council-shadow-governance.html`

**That's it!** The AI features will now work because both the web app and Ollama are running locally.

## Why GitHub Pages Won't Work

The GitHub Pages version (`https://yufok1.github.io/...`) **cannot connect to Ollama** due to fundamental browser security restrictions:

### GitHub Pages Demo (UI Only)
You can view the interface at: [https://yufok1.github.io/Canvas-with-observation-feeds-HTML/canvas-with-observation-feeds.html](https://yufok1.github.io/Canvas-with-observation-feeds-HTML/canvas-with-observation-feeds.html)

**This is for UI demonstration only** - the AI features will not work due to CORS restrictions.

### CORS Security Restriction
- Browsers block remote websites from accessing `localhost` resources
- This is a security feature to prevent malicious sites from accessing your local services
- GitHub Pages is considered a "remote origin" even though you own the repository

### The Error You See
```
Access to fetch at 'http://localhost:11434/api/generate' from origin 'https://yufok1.github.io' has been blocked by CORS policy
```

This error is **expected and cannot be fixed** for the GitHub Pages version.

### Browser Workarounds (Not Recommended)
Some browsers allow disabling CORS for development, but this:
- Reduces your security
- May not work reliably
- Is not suitable for production use

**Recommendation**: Use the local version - it's more secure, faster, and fully functional. The GitHub Pages version is only for UI demonstration.

```bash
# Download and install Ollama from https://ollama.ai/
# Follow platform-specific installation instructions
```

### 2. Pull Required Models
```bash
# Pull the unified model used by all AI systems
ollama pull gemma3:1b
```

### 3. Start Ollama Server
```bash
# Start Ollama in a terminal
ollama serve
```


### 4. Launch the Application
You **must** run a local web server to access the application. Directly opening the HTML file (using `file://`) will cause issues with browser security, localStorage, and AI connectivity.

Start a local server (choose one):
```bash
# Using Python (recommended)
python -m http.server 8000

# Using Node.js (alternative)
npx http-server -p 8000
```

Then access the app via: [http://localhost:8000/canvas-with-observation-feeds.html](http://localhost:8000/canvas-with-observation-feeds.html)

The interface will automatically connect to Ollama on localhost:11434 for all AI features. All traffic and data remain local to your machine.

## Configuration

### Model Assignment
Models are configured in the `optimizedModelMap` object:
```javascript
const optimizedModelMap = {
    djinn: "gemma3:1b",
    nazar: "gemma3:1b",
    // ... other systems
};
```

#### Ollama Agent Interchangeability
The AI systems are fully interchangeable with any Ollama-compatible model. To change models:

1. **Pull the desired model**:
   ```bash
   ollama pull [model-name]
   # Examples:
   ollama pull llama2:7b
   ollama pull mistral:7b
   ollama pull codellama:7b
   ```

2. **Update the configuration** in `canvas-with-observation-feeds.html`:
   ```javascript
   const optimizedModelMap = {
       djinn: "llama2:7b",        // Governance & strategic analysis
       nazar: "mistral:7b",       // Consciousness & fractal analysis
       narra: "codellama:7b",     // Pattern recognition
       whale: "gemma3:1b",        // Memory & interrogation
       watchtower: "llama2:7b"    // Monitoring & metrics
   };
   ```

3. **Considerations for model selection**:
   - **Context window**: Larger models (7B+) handle longer conversations better
   - **Speed vs. quality**: Smaller models (1B-3B) are faster but less detailed
   - **Specialization**: Code-focused models work well for technical analysis
   - **Memory usage**: Larger models require more RAM
   - **Compatibility**: Ensure the model supports the required API endpoints

4. **Testing new models**:
   - Start with one system to test compatibility
   - Monitor response quality and speed
   - Adjust polling intervals if needed for slower models
   - Check console logs for any API compatibility issues

### Caching Settings
Adjust cache durations in the `intelligentCache` configuration:
```javascript
CACHE_DURATION: 180000,    // 3 minutes for responses
CONTEXT_DURATION: 300000,  // 5 minutes for context
SYNTHESIS_DURATION: 600000 // 10 minutes for synthesis
```

### Polling Intervals
Activity-based polling intervals:
```javascript
pollingIntervals: {
    high: 120000,    // 2 minutes when active
    medium: 300000,  // 5 minutes when moderate
    low: 600000      // 10 minutes when idle
}
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Batch File Won't Start**
- Ensure Python is installed and in your PATH
